# Whitepapers and Architectures

## AWS Well-Archictected Framework and Well-Architected Tool

- [Well Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected)
- stop guessing at capacity needs, use Auto Scaling Groups
- test systems at production scale
- automate to make your architectural experimentation easier
  - design based on changing requirments
- driver architectures using data
- improve though game days
  - simulate applications for flash sale days

### 6 Pillars of a Well-Architected Framework

1. Operation Excellence
2. Security
3. Reliability
4. Performance Efficiency
5. Cost Optimization
6. Sustainability

- **they are not something to balance, or trade-offs, they're a synergy**

### Well-Architected Tool

- [Well-Architected Tool](https://console.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/)
- [Well-Architected Tool Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/userguide/intro.html)
- free tool to **review you architectures** against the 6 pillars of a Well-Architected Framework and **adopt architectural best practices**
- how does it work?
  - select your workload and answer questions
  - review your answers against the 6 Pillars
  - obtain advice: get videos and documentation, generate a report, see the results in a dashboard
